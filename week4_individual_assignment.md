Reflection on R

Using the program R with our moderator I was reminded of the user interface of Python and commonalities in logic and context that run through these languages. It felt like understanding spanish or french after having experienced a course on Latin, or a distantly related language. Principles behind pulling the data and even plotting it were vaguely similar to how we ran data in python (side note: it did not suprise me how much vacant housing exists in Florida.) I would've like to know whether the 0 dilemma persists in R as well, considering FIPS code is still used. To construct graphs that show statistical significance, R would be a great benefit in sorting and analyzing through data more effectively, especially when working through multiple large datasets.
