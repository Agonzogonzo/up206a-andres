Both articles by Boeing were interesting to me based on my limited experience in understanding and using GEPHI and networking extensions for ArcMaps and QGIS. 
The use of programs like QSMNX can lead to more effective methods of network and systems-based planning that can address key inefficiencies in how a transit 
or other urban network is laid out. It can also express the overlay of elements and factors that connect systems across sectors, such as the network of water, 
and electricity lines and the localization of disaster evacuation paths and shelters. 

How would a program such as QSMNX address inequities in the lived spatial landscape though? Connectivity as understood through the definitions provided can 
be mapped out across networks. But what information might not be reflected in the definitions and indicators of connectivity Boeing created? Boeing’s use of 
census tract level data and the localization of that information in studying griddedness was one step in understanding the nuances of individual spaces. How 
can these be methods used in combination with other forms of research to understand a wider scope of connectivity in network mapping.

Questions for the author:
Can OSMNX integrate data on the impact of disasters on network mapping? What could it’s application in addressing drastic environmental changes and long-term disruption of network systems?
